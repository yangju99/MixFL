## 📄 MixFL: Adaptive Mixing of Embeddings from Multiple Code Language Models for Fault Localization 

This is the online repository for 19th IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST) 2026 accepted paper, **"Adaptive Mixing of Embeddings from Multiple
Code Language Models for Fault Localization"**. 

### 🖼️ Overview Image

![overview image](overview.png)

### 🧪 Dataset  
We use **Defects4J-V1.4.0**.  
> ⚠️ Note: The buggy items in v1.4.0 are identical to those in v1.2.0. We choose v1.4.0 to avoid issues in v1.2.0.

---

## 🚀 Run MixFL

### 1. Generate Code and Comment Embeddings  
For each method covered by failing test cases, we generate embeddings using each CodeLM (for both code and comments).

```bash
./LLM_embeddings/generate_embeddings_1.sh
```

> Embeddings will be saved in: `LLM_embeddings/defects4j_1.4.0_chunks/`

---

### 2. Run Leave-One-Out Validation  
For **all CodeLM combinations**, run leave-one-out validation for each project.

```bash
python leave_one_out_project_all.py
```

---

### 📁 Check Results  
All experiment results will be stored in the `results/` directory.
